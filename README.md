oscillator
==========

Various python2.7 modules for estimating oscillator properties from periodic time course data


This code is pretty specific and may have limited value for general use.
The file metrics.py provides methods for estimating the complex order parameters
for a system of oscillators.  The file variables.py provides methods
for calculating properties like phase and so on.

Many dependencies
